# About this branch
This branch adds 3 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
* Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Poké Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites until I'm able to get new ones for the new pockets.

To-Do:
* New bag sprites.
